# ðŸš€ clj8 Implementation Plan

## 0. Vision & Goals

- **Clojure-native Kubernetes toolkit**: Seamlessly integrate Kubernetes operations into idiomatic, functional, data-first Clojure workflows.
- **Data-driven core**: APIs, schemas, and invocation are driven by *data* (maps, keywords, vectors)â€”no hardcoding, maximum flexibility.
- **Rich metadata everywhere**: Use Clojureâ€™s metadata features to expose documentation, schemas, parameter hints, and operation info at both runtime and dev-time.
- **Two-layer API**:
  - **Layer 1**: *Data-driven registry*â€”all endpoints, schemas, and operations are described as data, supporting advanced automation, dynamic routing, introspection, and scripting.
  - **Layer 2**: *Macro-generated idiomatic functions*â€”automatically create ergonomic, documented Clojure functions for each endpoint, with metadata for editors and discoverability, built on the data-driven core.
- **Editor/tooling support**: Make full use of argument lists, docstrings, and custom metadata so that tools like CIDER, Calva, and VSCode give rich auto-completion, hints, and inline docs.
- **Composability & extensibility**: Support transducers, streaming, generative testing, and custom middleware.
- **Cross-platform**: Works across JVM (Clojure), JavaScript (ClojureScript), and Babashka.

## 1. Scaffold the Polylith Monorepo

- Use [Polylith](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/) for best-in-class modularity.
- Create a structure for **bricks** (reusable components), **bases** (entrypoints/apps), and **projects** (dev/test/app).

---

## 2. Core Bricks and Responsibilities

### `core`
- Common types, protocols, and error-handling helpers.
- Utility functions for the whole system.

### `malli`
- Convert OpenAPI schemas to Malli schemas for validation, coercion, and test data generation.
- Expose Malli schema registry for all Kubernetes resources.
- Support generative testing (property-based, fuzzing) from schemas.

### `registry`
- Load/parse the OpenAPI spec as data.
- Generate a **registry**: a map of human-friendly operation keywords (`:list-pods`, `:get-pod`, etc) to endpoint metadata.
- Attach operation metadata: HTTP method, path, docstrings (from OpenAPI), parameter names/types, Malli schemas, links to OpenAPI, etc.
- All registry entries include **rich metadata** for introspection and editor support.

### `macros`
- Provide a macro (`defk8sapi-fns` or similar) that:
  - Walks the registry and generates one function per operation, with ergonomic argument lists and Malli schemas/docstrings as metadata.
  - All generated functions call the data-driven core.
  - This makes function signatures, docstrings, and schema information available to editors and REPL help (`doc`, completion, etc).

### `client`
- Orchestrate the HTTP/API requests for all platforms (clj/cljs/bb).
- Templatize paths, apply query params, and use Malli for input/output coercion and validation.
- Expose a single `invoke` function that can be called directly, or by the macro-generated layer.

---

## 3. Bases

### `api`
- Loads the registry and macros, providing the ready-to-use, doc-rich API surface.

---

## 4. Project

### `dev`
- REPL for developing, testing, and exploring the system.
- Example usage: dynamic calls, macro-expansion, docstring inspection, generative tests.

---

## 5. Resource

- Download and store Kubernetes OpenAPI spec in `resources/k8s-openapi.json`.
- Allow easy updating for different Kubernetes versions.

---

## 6. Development Steps

1. **Registry:**
    - Parse OpenAPI, extract endpoints, generate clean names, attach metadata and Malli schemas.
    - Make the registry itself queryable (for scripting/UIs).

2. **Malli:**
    - OpenAPI â†’ Malli schema conversion for all request/response types.
    - Attach schemas to registry and expose helpers for validation/coercion/generation.

3. **Invoke:**
    - Data-driven API call (method, path, params, schemas), used by both registry and generated functions.

4. **Macros:**
    - Macro expands into idiomatic functions, reading metadata from the registry.
    - Each function gets:
      - Clean, discoverable name (e.g., `list-pods`)
      - Ergonomic arglist
      - **Docstring** (from OpenAPI)
      - **Malli schemas** (as metadata)
      - **Parameter metadata** (for editor hints)
      - **OpenAPI path/method info** (for traceability and advanced UIs)

5. **Client:**
    - HTTP glue for all platforms.
    - Middleware/interceptor support for extension.

6. **Dev:**
    - Add dev scripts, tests, and usage examples (including transducer pipelines and generative property tests).

---

## 7. Editor/Tooling Support

- All macro-generated functions should include `:doc`, `:arglists`, and `:malli/request-schema`, `:malli/response-schema` in their metadata.
- Ensure `clojure.repl/doc`, CIDER/Calva/VSCode/IntelliJ show all endpoint info and parameter hints.
- Registry should allow easy introspection and lookup for UIs or scripting.

---

## 8. Transducers & Composability

- All API results should be lazy sequences or channel sources, ready for `sequence`/`transduce`.
- Provide transducer-ready helpers for common queries, joins, merges, filtering, and resource streaming.
- Support property-based and generative testing for all endpoints/resources.

---

## 9. Stretch/Future Goals

- **CLI/Script tools:** Babashka-based command-line utilities.
- **Web UI:** CLJS/Reagent dashboard for live K8s introspection.
- **Custom resource (CRD) support.**
- **Automatic doc/gen site** using registry and metadata.

---

# ðŸŸ¢ Key Architectural Ideas & Philosophy

- **Data-Driven:**  
  Everything is a map. Endpoints, schemas, and operations are described as data, not code.
- **Metadata Everywhere:**  
  All API functions and registry entries carry rich metadata (doc, schemas, param hints, OpenAPI links) for runtime and dev-time discovery.
- **Two-Layer API:**  
  - Data-driven core for automation, scripting, introspection, and meta-programming.  
  - Macro-generated idiomatic layer for ergonomic, discoverable, doc-rich functions in the REPL/editor.
- **Editor Support:**  
  Metadata, docstrings, and arglists are exposed for deep integration with editor tooling, auto-complete, inline docs, and help systems.
- **Composable/Extensible:**  
  Transducer and middleware support for resource streaming, automation, and integration with other Clojure tools.
- **Cross-Platform:**  
  Works on Clojure, ClojureScript, and Babashkaâ€”build once, use anywhere.
